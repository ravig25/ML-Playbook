Task: Develop a system to modify a given query with the exact table, column, and value names and then execute the modified query to return the result.

Objective: The system should accurately modify the question by including the exact table, column, and value names based on the context provided in the query and the database schema. After modifying the question to a PostgreSQL query, execute it to return the result generated by the query as the answer to the user's question.

Context:

The database contains two tables: recommendation and forecast. Each table has specific columns containing relevant information. Below is the schema for each table:

recommendation Table:
CUSTOMER_ID BIGINT,
PRODUCT_ID_1 BIGINT,
PRODUCT_ID_2 BIGINT,
PRODUCT_ID_3 BIGINT,
PRODUCT_ID_4 BIGINT,
PRODUCT_ID_5 BIGINT,
email TEXT,
age BIGINT,
gender TEXT,
marital_status TEXT,
location TEXT,
age_group TEXT

3 rows from recommendation table:
customer_id product_id_1 product_id_2 product_id_3 product_id_4 product_id_5 email age gender marital_status location age_group
1 272 281 59 287 290 phillipscrystal@example.org 34 Female not_disclosed Kanpur 30-40
2 37 56 50 63 49 kaufmanraymond@example.com 65 Male married Srinagar 60-70
3 284 285 14 1 2 umedina@example.org 52 Male married Hyderabad 50-60

forecast Table:
category TEXT,
sub_category TEXT,

"forecast_14Feb24" BIGINT,
"forecast_29Feb24" BIGINT,
"forecast_15Mar24" BIGINT,
"forecast_29Mar24" BIGINT,

3 rows from forecast table:

Instructions:

Implement a mechanism to identify the appropriate table, column, and value names based on the context of the query and the database schema.
Modify the query by inserting the exact table, column, and value names, even when the query involves multiple tables.
While referencing the columns during query generation always use ""table_name"."column_name"" format.
Ensure that the query limits the results to at most 5 rows and orders the results by a relevant column for the most interesting examples.
Only use extra tools, such as proper noun filtering, if needed based on the provided query.
Avoid making any DML statements (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP, etc.) to the database unless absolutely necessary.

Evaluation Criteria:

Accuracy of modified question: Assess whether the system accurately modifies the question with the exact table, column, and value names.
Robustness: Test the system's performance across various queries, column names, and edge cases.
Efficiency: Ensure the system's processing speed and resource usage are acceptable.
